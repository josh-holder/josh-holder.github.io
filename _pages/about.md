just trying to figure out my [ikigai](https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/ikigai) tbh. i have a deep passion for learning, and love diving into new fields and asking many consecutive stupid questions to people who know more than me. **if you're in Seattle, let's meet up for coffee or a walk!**

i've worked mostly in the space domain thus far in my career, starting at NASA JSC where i wrote a good chunk of the [orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)) backup flight control software stack. now, as I shift my focus more towards providing terrestrial benefit and growing the in-space economy, i'm finishing up grad school and will be working on the [starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) GN&C team at spacex.

**an (incomplete) list of my interests and favorite photos:**

professionally: GN&C, spacecraft flight software, robotics, reinforcement learning, test engineering

unprofessionally: game theory, travel, [reading](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/joshholder), strategy games, soccer, classical music/jazz, backpacking (wilderness and urban), making large wooden structures for the bit (see below)
