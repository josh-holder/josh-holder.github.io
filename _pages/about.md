title: "about me"

i've worked mostly in the space domain thus far in my career, starting at NASA JSC where i wrote a good chunk of the [orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)) backup flight control software stack. space exploration is, in my mind, the most pure and exciting human pursuit in tech and it's a blast to contribute every day.

i've also had interests in RL, which I explored in my brief stint in academia (see [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=H9c37N4AAAAJ)).

currently, i help fly 8000 satellites safely and autonomously as part of the [starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) GN&C team at spacex. this role and my experience w/ RL have made me passionate about the potentials and perils of next-gen autonomy systems - i've done some writing on this over on [substack](https://substack.com/@joshholder)!

**i love hosting people and learning new things. if you're in Seattle, let's meet up for coffee or a walk!**

**an (incomplete) list of my interests and favorite photos:**

professionally: GN&C, spacecraft flight software, robotics, reinforcement learning, simulation engineering

unprofessionally: game theory, [incredibly long biographies](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/joshholder), strategy games, soccer, backpacking (wilderness and urban), making large wooden structures for the bit (see below)
