With terminal-phase Guidance Navigation and Control in the news lately with the (qualified) success of (Intuitive Machines){https://spacenews.com/im-1-lunar-lander-tipped-over-on-its-side/} and (JAXA's){https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/japans-1st-moon-lander-has-hit-its-target-but-it-appears-to-be-upside-down} lunar landers, I wanted to provide an approachable look at the mathematics of rocket landing, and the ways it's both easier and harder than you might expect.
