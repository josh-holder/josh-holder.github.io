To address the ever-increasing problem of space debris, I propose a solution involving electrically-propulsed Small-Sats. The focus of this investigation is on the big-picture feasibility of the mission from an orbital mechanics perspective, but everything from the economics of the mission to debris rendezvous and capture is touched upon.
